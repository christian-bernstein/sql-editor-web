## Philosophy & Motivation
I started the SQL-Editor project in mid 2021, based on an earlier project from 2019. 
The front and backend were parts of an optional project I made for my high school graduation in 2022.

The objective was to create an easy-to-use, web-based environment for students at my school to learn and get comfortable 
writing SQL and interacting with real databases. For me, it was a great opportunity to start diving into web development.

## Updates & Issues
This project is archived. I won't continue adding new features or resolve security vulnerabilities and bugs.
