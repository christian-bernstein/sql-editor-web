This repository contains the SQL-Editor frontend source
<br>
**At the moment, SQL-Editor is not yet meant for public usage. It may contain critical bugs & security breaches.**

<br>
<br>

## Philosophy & Motivation
I started the SQL-Editor project in mid 2021, based on an earlier project from 2019. The frontend and backend 
(which is not open source yet) were part of an optional graduation project I made for my high school graduation in 2022.

The objective was to create an easy-to-use, web-based environment for students at my school to learn and get comfortable 
writing SQL and interacting with real databases. For me, it was a great opportunity to start diving into web development.

## Timeline

**Future**
<br>
I plan on revisiting the project, cleaning up the codebase, making the UI simpler and faster & improve overall functionality.
I also plan on releasing a finished version of the editor to the public.
*(Although a fully functioning version of the editor is currently available under
[https://christian-bernstein.de/sql/1 ~> SQL Editor (wss protocol)](https://christian-bernstein.de/sql/1)
it is not advised to use it for anything else then 'playing around'.)*
